                    Howdy! I am an honors Computer Engineering major in the <a href = https://engineering.tamu.edu/about/index.html>Texas A&M University</a> Class of 2024 with minors in cybersecurity and math. 
                    With multiple internships in software engineering and coursework across computer science and electrical engineering, I thoroughly enjoy problem solving and facing new challenges. 
                    Outside of classes, I am involved in leadership for several student organizations. You can read more about my internships and other involvement throughout my page.
