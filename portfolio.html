                    I began with a maintenance project for a database viewer using Java. 
                    However, a software migration of a different project meant that I had to switch to a C# based user interaction update. 
                    I had never used C# before but welcomed the challenge and was able to complete the task which included formal design review, implementation, and code review before merging with main. 
                    This was a great opportunity for me to practice tracing other people's code and learn the importance of documentaiton at every step of the development process.

                    The primary project for the last 6 weeks of my internship was integration of an entirely new radio system on an unmanned aerial vehicle sensor processor software system in C++. I sent commands that set values like customized ip address, baud rate, power level, time, date. 
                    Each mentioned command required following process:
                <ol>
                    <li>write to the serial port and change the radio into program mode</li>
                    <li>reading from the serial port</li>
                    <li>parse the resposne to confirm the radio mode</li>
                    <li>send the appropiate command with careful mind to radio internal command line interface (CLI) syntax</li>
                    <li>writing and reading to return to normal mode</li>
                    <li>writing the test command and parsing the response read to ensure the relevant command was properly sent</li>
                </ol>
                    There was a significant amount of testing involved to determine that all values were properly set and any issues could be fixed by the program if a certain command was not properly sent. 
                    In my testing and refactoring stage I was able to improve the setup time by about 50% and remove thousands of lines of code. My code flew before the end of my internship.
