                    Class Councils, as a representative body, strives to serve and unite Texas A&M University and to enhance traditions for the continual improvement of the Aggie community. Traditions that are put on by Class Councils include Fish Fest, Pull Out Day, Elephant Walk, Ring Dance, and Legacy Night. 
                    Our mission is to build spirit by unifying the classes through Aggie Traditions. Some service opportunities I participate in through councils are Adopt a Street and Aggie Replant.

                    It allows opportunities to volunteer to help freshmen learn more about engineering majors through DEI Saturday. 
                    It also provides seminars and networking opportunities with leaders in academia and industry.

                    Aggie Muster is a tradition unique to Texas A&M University that embodies and perpetuates the Aggie Spirit. Celebrated on April 21st every year, Muster engages thousands of Aggies worldwide to honor and celebrate the Aggie Family past, present, and future. 
                    Although over a century has passed and thousands of Musters have been held, the roots remain the same of honoring the Aggies who have passed and celebrating those gathered together. 
                    Participating in the Muster Host program in 2022 was a fantastic way for me to give back to the Aggie community and comfort a family.
